For building on different platforms run
```console
$ make PLATFORM=windows
```

The ones that are supported by raylib are windows, darwin (OSX) and linux, so those are the ones we support too.

NOTE: that compiling for a platform requires you to be on the paticular platform, this is just a simple makefile and doesn't handle cross compilation without the specific tools.
